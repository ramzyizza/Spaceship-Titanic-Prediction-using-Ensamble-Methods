## Introduction
In 2912, the Spaceship Titanic encountered a spacetime anomaly, resulting in half of its 13,000 passengers being transported to another dimension. This study analyzes the recovered data to identify the affected individuals, employing advanced preprocessing and feature engineering techniques. The research compares these methods against baseline models, emphasizing the importance of proper data handling and hyperparameter tuning in predictive accuracy.

## Methodology
The study's methodology contrasts two distinct preprocessing and feature engineering approaches, referred to as methods (1) and (2), against simpler baseline methods. It involves various stages of data handling, including imputation, encoding, and scaling, before applying several classification models. The comprehensive flowchart details the process, highlighting the parallel paths taken for comparative analysis.
